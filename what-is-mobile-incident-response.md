# What is Mobile Incident Response

## Incident response overview
Incident response has been around for decades.

- reference cuckoo's egg book?

>Incident response is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or attack (also known as an incident). The goal is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs. An incident response plan includes a policy that defines, in specific terms, what constitutes an incident and provides a step-by-step process that should be followed when an incident occurs. [^1] 

Closely connected with mobile forensics. Mention (at least) AWH's 2 existing books?

Mention SANS 6 steps?

1. Preparation
2. Identification
3. Containment
4. Eradication
5. Recovery
6. Lessons learned

Mention NIST "Computer Security Incident Handling Guide" framework?

This will be covered more full in the Chapter "Framework for Mobile Incident Response" (how to make this an internal link?)

## How is mobile IR different than traditional computers?

# Common Mobile Incidents
There are a number of common scenarios you will encounter when it performing IR for mobile devices:

Use MLA? Use [easybib](http://www.easybib.com/reference/guide/mla/website) to assist? No, site sux with adds as did the other 2-3 I checked. Maybe we just get a few references in here (a lot will be URLs, some books and pubs) and then just copy/paste?
