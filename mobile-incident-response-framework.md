* Provide suggestions for how to adapt the framework to mobile devices


Mention SANS 6 steps?

1. Preparation
2. Identification
3. Containment
4. Eradication
5. Recovery
6. Lessons learned

Mention NIST ["Computer Security Incident Handling Guide"](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf) framework:

* performing incident response effectively is a complex undertaking, establishing a successful incident response capability requires substantial planning and resources. 
* assists organizations in establishing computer security incident response capabilities and handling incidents efficiently and effectively. 
* provides guidelines for incident handling, particularly for analyzing incident-related data and determining the appropriate response to each incident. 
* Independently of particular hardware platforms, operating systems, protocols, or applications.
