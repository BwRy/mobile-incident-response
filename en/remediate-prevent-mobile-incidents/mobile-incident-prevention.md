# Mobile Incident Prevention

The final steps in any IR process and ultimately the goal of the security and incident response teams is to prevent incident. In this section, we will explore techniques and processes companies can take to reduce their mobile risk. 

## Historical data

Historical data about a mobile device can mean the difference between quickly identifying mobile incident or never resolvig the case. This information can include information such as:

* App information
    * Install apps and current version
    * App update history
* Device and OS information
    * OS version and update history
    * Radio version
* Network information
    * Wi-Fi and cellular connection history
    * Networks connected to
* Geo-location to determine localized attacks
* Vulnerabilities
    * Known app flaws (security and privacy)
    * Known OS flaws
    * Known SDK and 3rd-party library flaws
* etc...:w

could then be easily mapped to know flaws and prioritize steps which can immediately reduce mobile risk.

## Continuous Improvement

One of the key steps in the Mobile Incident Response Framework is learning from the current incident and using that information to prevent future incidents. Let's use the IR Exercise as our example....
