# Defining Incident Response

The goal of incident response is to quickly contain and mitigate incident. It's helpful to provide a more formal definition of incident response ("IR"):

>Incident response is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or attack (also known as an incident). The goal is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs. An incident response plan includes a policy that defines, in specific terms, what constitutes an incident and provides a step-by-step process that should be followed when an incident occurs. [^2]

Over the past 3 decades, the process of incident response has matured. Bruce Schneier, a respected security technologist, wrote about evolution and future of IR in his popular [Schneier on Security](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/11/the_future_of_i.html) [^3] blog. He identified broad focuses in each decade since the 1990s starting with protection, then moving into detection and finally focused on response by the 2010s.

He reflected that in recent years, new IR products and services are being developed and implemented due to three important trends:

1. Devices and data now regularly reside outside the control of IT departments (mobile, cloud, etc.)
2. Attack and threats are far more sophisticated and effective
3. Companies continue to under-invest protection and detection, increasing the need for response

The trend of companies under-investing in security is, unfortunately, a clear reality in mobile.

This amplifies the need for mobile incident response as the technology and data is clearly distributed, generally outside the control of IT and have a large number of security and privacy flaws.
