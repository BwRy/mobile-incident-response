# A brief history of incident response
On November 2, 1998, Robert Tappan Morris released the first Internet worm (dubbed the Morris Worm) and became part of computer security history by:

1. Unleashing the first large scale denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the Internet
2. Impacting an estimated (and refuted) 10% of computers on the Internet at that time (6,000 impacted)
3. Being the first person prosecuted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)

The impact to the Internet plus the significant challenges in coordinating a response in such a distributed environment led to the creation of the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC) by DARPA in 1988.[^1] The goal of the CERT organization was to provide the central hub for communicating and coordinating a response to security incident. 

The [CERT/CC](https://cert.org/) flourishes today and is part of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

## CERT Organizations

There is a large group of resources support CERTs around the world. They can be loosly organized into three types based on their sponsors:

1. Government
1. Enterprise
1. Community 

Below is a list of various organizations which often provide extensive information and at times support during an incident.

### Government-sponsored CERTs / CSIRTs

These organizations generally coordinate incident responses for entire nations. 

1. [US-CERT](https://www.us-cert.gov/) (United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team)
1. [ENISA](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/) (European Union Agency for Network and Information Security)

### Enterprise-sponsored CERTs / CSIRTs

These organization, while focused on a particular enterprise, have a visibile public presence and sometimes include supporting the industry with educational information and tools:

1. MSFT?
1. Does CMU Cert go here? Create .edu one?

### Community

1. [FIRST](http://www.first.org/) (global Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams) 
 

## Digital Forensics and Incident Response

Incident response is closely connected with forensics as nearly every incident requires the collection, storage and analysis of digital evidence.  

As you explore mobile incident response more thoroughly, these books can provide far deeper technical details on mobile forensics and security.
