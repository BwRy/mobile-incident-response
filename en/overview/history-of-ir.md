# A brief history of incident response
On November 2, 1998, Robert Tappan Morris released the first Internet worm (dubbed the Morris Worm) and became part of computer security history by:

1. Unleashing the first large scale denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the Internet
2. Impacting an estimated (and refuted) 10% of computers on the Internet at that time (6,000 impacted)
3. Being the first person prosecuted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)

The impact to the Internet plus the significant challenges in coordinating a response in such a distributed environment led to the creation of the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC) by DARPA in 1988.[^1] The [CERT/CC](https://cert.org/) flourishes today and is part of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.
