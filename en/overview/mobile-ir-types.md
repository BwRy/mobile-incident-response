# Common Mobile Incidents
Here listed are a number of common scenarios you may encounter when responding to a mobile incident:

* Mobile malware discovered
* Device acting suspiciously
* Device lost or stolen
* Insider attack via mobile device
* Support for an internal investigation (e.g., e-discovery, legal hold) 
* Data breach via mobile device

## Mobile malware discovered
While mobile malware is overhyped by the security industry, it certainly exists. It is more prevelant in the Android ecosystem due the the ability to more easily distrubute and install apps outside the Play Store.

The two most common mobile malware incidents encoutered are:

1. Malware installed on an individual's device
1. Malware impersonating your brand

The first situation generally impact a single or small group of devices that are part of our organization (i.e. corporate-owned devices, BYOD, consultants).

In the second scenario, an unathorized actor generally publishes a mobile app that targets your customers by impersonating your brand. Since this impacts your customers, the response steps vary significantly from an individual incident.

We dicsuss both of these scenarios ooin our Case Study section and develop incident response playbooks for them as well.

## Device acting suspiciously
In many instances, an employee or contractor will inform the security or incident response team that their device is acting suspicuosly. This is a challenging scenarios due to:

* Limimted visibility into the device
* Lack of historical data
* Many possible explanations (only some would be an incident)
* Sensitive nature of accessing an individual's mobile device
* Urgency due to potential impact and utility of a mobile device
* Accurateness of reporter

## Device lost or stolen
A lost or stolen mobile device is a scenario that is probably the most well understood. Both Android and iOS have built in capabilities for findings, locking and performing a remote wipe.

However, the the information provided in this book, there's a opportunity to better understand the potential impact of this type of event provided the security team has access to device properties (OS version, list of installed app). Armed with this information, a much better understand of the data at risk can inform the response and resolution of the incident. 

## Insider attack via mobile device
Detecting insider attacks are incredibly difficult, even more so on mobile device since more limited device telemetry is available and security tools are still evolving. The mostly likely event would involve an indivdual already under suspicion and a general investigation of the mobile device(s) becomes relevant.   

## Support for an internal investigation 
Internal investigations, especially at larger organizations, are fairly common. Examples include:

* Departing employee data theft
* Violation of company policies
* Litigation freeze or e-discovery request

## Data breach via mobile device
As mobile devices play a greater role in the daily operations of large organizations, there is an increased risk of sensitive data (e.g. customer data, PII) being leaked out or breached in an attack. While many incident response teams have well practices responses for incidents like this involved servers, very few have addressed the growing risk in mobile devices.
