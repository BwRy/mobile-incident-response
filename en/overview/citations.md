# Citations

Let's mimic what [Wikipedia does for citations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tappan_Morris#References). We can use their style (MLA?) and then either the ^1 approach for a footnote or just the id in brackets. The disadvantage is we might have to manually re-number links. I'm open to other ideas!
