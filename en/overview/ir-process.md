# Incident Response Process

The [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/) has defined 6 key IR steps in their book [Computer Security Incident Handling: Step-by-Step](http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Security-Incident-Handling-Step-/dp/0972427376/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436392071&sr=8-1&keywords=Computer+Security+Incident+Handling%3A+Step-by-Step):

1. Preparation
2. Identification
3. Containment
4. Eradication
5. Recovery
6. Lessons learned

While we will cover this topic extensively in the chapter [Framework for Mobile Incident Response](mobile-incident-response-framework.md) and build upon frameworks from both SANS and NIST.

## Digital Forensics and Incident Response

Incident response is closely connected with forensics as nearly every incident requires the collection, storage and analysis of digital evidence.  This is a topic the authors and NowSecure employees have written about extensively since 2011:

As you explore mobile incident response more thoroughly, these books can provide far deeper technical details on mobile forensics and security.
