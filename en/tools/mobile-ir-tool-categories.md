# Categories of Mobile IR Tools

It's helpful to characterize mobile incident response tools into four broad categories:

1. Continuous Monitoring
2. Device Acquisition
3. Analysis
4. Prevention

In this section, we will describes these categories of tools and provide more detailed examples. In the subsequent sections, we will provide a list of tools that are open source, free as well as breifly explore commercial tools.

## Continuous Monitoring

* Baseine devices
* Proactive acquisition of device information

## Device Acquisition

* Device Triage
  * OS, installed apps, running processes
* Device Acquisition
  * logical
  * backup
  * physical
* Proxying network traffic?

## Analysis

* Forensic Analysis
  * Timeline analysis
  * searching
  * etc..
* Behavorial
  * Device/app from inidivual, group, company, functional or app/OS baseline
* Comparative
