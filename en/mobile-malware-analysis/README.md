Notes from Sebas re: this chapter:

> re: Malware Analysis Chapter, from my point of view, I think it would be great to have at least few pages dedicated to it, in order to show how to conduct an analysis using a real case scenario
> There are multiple books out there, that describe the tools, etc... but at the end, that's merely a transitory state where you just have to launch tools and analyze the output, we might provide an insightful point of view about our methodology
> and some techniques, steps, that we have gained across the years
