# Android Malware Analysis

The section will provide a high level process for analyzing Android malware and examples will leverage the NowSecure Platform.

# First encounter - Creating a safe environment
The most important step before analyzing a piece of malware, is to setup a controlled environment where the sample can be triggered and its behavior analyzed.

If the setup is done correctly, it will help the analyst to obtain a strong knowledge of the functionalities and behavior implemented within the malware. However, in order to obtain a complete understanding of the malware's logic, a static and dynamic analysis are required. This is the real path to analyze and disassembly a piece of malware.

The purpose of this section, is to describe in details how to configure and prepare a laboratory for analyzing different types of malware, no previous experience is required, as our intention is to keep it as simple and minimalistic as possible.

## Setting up the emulator
### Introduction
Nowadays, the growth that Android has suffered is considerable, and the alternatives out there in the market to setup an emulator are numerous. Like everything else, each one has their advantages and disadvantages, being the user the one who has to decide which one fills his needs.

Obviously, not all of them offer the same functionalities, and their use is focalized to different purposes that might not be in line with actual needs. The list is in continous expansion, however we attempted to narrow it to the most significant ones:

#### Android SDK / AVD
The Android SDK includes a device emulator that runs on the computer.  The Android emulator mimics all the hardware and software features of a traditional and real mobile device, except that it is not capable of perform phone calls, or make a proper use of NFC capabilities (*Are we sure of this?*)

*[Insert screenshot]*

The emulator makes use of Android Virtual Device (AVD) configurations, that let the user defines specific hardware aspects, and allow to create multiple configurations to test numerous Android platforms and hardware combinations.

It runs a full Android system stack, from user to kernel level. There are multiple Android system images available through the Android SDK Manager, which contain code for the Android Linux Kernel, the Dalvik VM, the native libraries, and various Android packages. Moreover, the emulator provides dynamic binary translation of device machine code to the operating system, and processor architecture of the development machine.

**Advantages**

* Full Android system stack
* Flexible, multiple configurations

**Disadvantages**

* No phone calls
* No NFC capabilities

*This is just an example, no needs to be here necessarily, maybe using a table?*

#### Android-x86
Is an unofficial initiative which aims to port Google's Android Mobile operating system to run on devices configured by AMD and Intel x86 processors. The OS is based on the Android Open Source Project, with minor modifications necessary to run it on PC architecture.

There are minor low-level components replaced to obtain a better performance, such as the kernel (*it runs on the long-term Linux Kernel available*), and Bionic library (*some components are replaced with others from GCC*).

**Note** *Drop few more paragraphs on Android-x86*

**Advantages**
* Android system can runs on a PC architecture.

**Disadvantages**
* Most dynamic utilities don't work on a PC architecture.

* Using the emulator
* How to analyze a malware with the emulator

## Using a real device
* Introduction
* Main advantages and disadvantages
* Which is the best device?
* Configuring the device
* How to analyze a malware with the device

# Exploring your toolset and techniques
* List of utilities commonly used to perform malware analysis

**Note** - Maybe we should divice the toolset based in distributions, decompilers, mobile sandboxes, etc?

#### Dex2Jar
Is a toolset to work with Android .dex and Java .class files. However, its main use is to convert Android's .dex format to Java's .class format,, ready to be analyzed with third parties utilities.

For more advanced users, they can give a try to these utilities:

* **dex-reader/writer** Read/Write the Dalvik Executable file.
*  **d2j-dex2jar** Convert .dex file to .class files.
*  **smali/baksmali** Disassemble dex to smali files and assemble dex from smali files
*  **d2j-decrypt-string** Utility constructed to defeat a specific strings encryption mechanism.

*[Include example on how to decompile classes.dex file]*

#### Dexter
#### Anubis
#### Android Decompiler (JEB)
#### IDA Pro
#### APKInspector

* What are best practices when reverse engineering/analyzing a piece of malware
	* Might be interesting to create a bullet point where best practices are described, brief, concise and clear


# Analyzing a real case
* Analyze a piece of malware from Hacking team, for example, created on purpose to perform surveillance.
