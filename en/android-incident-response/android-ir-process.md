# Android Incident Response Process

See overall process/framework chapter for general overview

## high level process

* distinguish between pre*root vs post*root incident response steps
* knowledge of prior configuration information helpful -- e.g., was device already rooted before incident
* develop a decision tree
* decide early, is goal legal action vs experiment conditions (e.g., honey potting).
* ideally try to decide/conclude whether the malicious software is still present or has been removed, if theory is that it has been removed, what artifacts might be left behind
* need to constantly track current rooting landscape. what privilege escalation exploits are currently available, what is the model of the attacker
* modeling the attacker
    * are we talking about a spouse spying or nation state?
